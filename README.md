## Back Story
In December of 2016, [WXPN](http://xpn.org)
did a multi-week alphabetical play list
called [A to Z](http://xpn.org/music-artist/885-countdown/2016/xpn-a-z).
For a bit of background on the playlist, see
[All about the XPN A to Z](http://thekey.xpn.org/2016/11/30/the-xpn-a-to-z/).
Early discussions about ordering,
specifically the question of treating articles as signification,
prompted me to do some analysis of the play list.

Initially, I'd hoped it might turn into something interesting.
I think it sort of did.
I ended up going down
a few interesting data spelunking efforts,
such as "what first word was most common?"
or "how did the distribution of artists differ between the play list
and XPN's normal programming?"
Honestly, I ended up spending more time than I planned
as the play list ran for over 17 days
and I was doing a combination of
rerunning the code to pick up new data,
trying to add new bits of data analysis,
adapting to changes I hadn't anticipated.

As I was doing this, two other listeners:
[Lena Bartell](https://twitter.com/LenaBartell)
and [Bruce Segal](https://twitter.com/besegal)
started doing similar efforts.
Working in parallel, I think,
inspired us all to dig deeper into the data.
It didn't hurt that we started getting shout-outs on air
and in the [#XPNAtoZ twitter stream](https://twitter.com/hashtag/XPNAtoZ).
Eventually we even got some press coverage.
Bruce's work was featured in 
[The #XPNAtoZ by the numbers](http://thekey.xpn.org/2016/12/10/the-xpnatoz-by-the-numbers/)
and 
a second article on [The Key](http://thekey.xpn.org)
had us 
[Meet Lena Bartell, #XPNAtoZ data nerd and massive music fan](http://thekey.xpn.org/2016/12/16/lena-bartell/).
Some of my work was featured on [Philly.com](http://www.philly.com)
in [Tuning into the WXPN A to Z marathon, alphabetically](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inthemix/Tuning-in-alphabetically-to-the-XPN-A-to-Z.html).
End of the day it was an absolute blast.

For my final results, see the 
[AtoZ notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asudell/a2z/blob/master/AtoZ.ipynb) on [jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
Do take time to checkout [Bruce's results](https://public.tableau.com/profile/besegal#!/vizhome/BESegalWXPNAtoZPlayListPublished/TheStoryWXPNAtoZMusicWrapUp)
as well as [Lena's results](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lena.bartell#!/vizhome/XPN_AtoZ/XPNA-ZPlaylistData) 
on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com).

In April 2017, there was a second [Leftovers](http://xpn.org/music-artist/az-leftovers) playlist
with all the non-alphabetical titles that were skipped before.
I've got some evolving data on that in the
[Leftovers notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asudell/a2z/blob/master/Leftovers.ipynb).

Since then there have been two more A-Z playlists.
Last Year there was a [XPN 70s A-Z](http://xpn.org/music-artist/885-countdown/2017/xpn-a-z) that was all 70s music.
And this year we went to the 80s with
[XPN 80s A-Z](http://www.xpn.org/music-artist/xpn-a-z).
I did notebooks for them as well:
[70's A-Z notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asudell/a2z/blob/master/70sA2Z.ipynb)
and
[80's A-Z notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asudell/a2z/blob/master/80sA2Z.ipynb)

After a year's hiatus, countdowns are back,
but in the previous listener curated style.
So in 2020 we have the
[XPN 2020 Countdown](https://xpn.org/music-artist/885-countdown/2020/).
I've started a notebook for that,
[XPN 2020 notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asudell/a2z/blob/master/XPN2020.ipynb).
And this year the station is doing stats as well,
as [The 2020 Countdown, By the Numbers](https://thekey.xpn.org/wxpn-2020-numbers/).
Be sure to check them out too.

In addition to my work, and [Bruce's](https://public.tableau.com/profile/besegal#!/vizhome/BESegalWXPNAtoZPlayListPublished/XPNAtoZFindYourSongfromAtoZ)
for the 80s A-Z,
[Lisa Bartlet](https://twitter.com/lmbartelt) did a real nice
[series of tweets](https://twitter.com/lmbartelt/status/1068110730233331713)
with word clouds for each letter.
The playlists generate a good bit of nerdy data play.
