# Text Analysis of XPN's A to Z Playlist

In December of 2016, [WXPN](http://xpn.org)
did a multi-week alphabetical play list
called [A to Z](http://xpn.org/music-artist/xpn-a-z).
Early discussions about ordering,
specifically the question of treating articles as signification,
prompted me to do some analysis of the play list.
Hopefully this will turn into something interesting.

For more info, see the [AtoZ notebook](AtoZ.ipynb)
in this project.
